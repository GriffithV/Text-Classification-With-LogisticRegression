# Text-Classification-With-LogisticRegression
* Reading the dataset and removing unnecessary characters
* Creating dictionaries representing 2 different topics from the read dataset 
* Training the model for these two dictionaries on the training dataset 
* C impelemantation of Adam, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Gradient Descent optimization techniques
* Evaluation of the model on the test dataset
* Using T-SNE imaging for comparison of optimization techniques and comparison of loss graphs
